It is well known that werewolves transform according to the phases of the moon, but what would happen in a location where there were no phases? The moon itself, for example? 
 
That is exactly what Alfie Wolford - notorious lycanthrope, flight school flunk-out, and would-be hijacker aimed to find out.

Now several weeks before, Alfie had gotten a job with NASA as the garbage collector. This had allowed him to bug all the important moon flight planning meetings. So he knew that the next launch was going to be this very evening. When he reported for work, he was ready to make a break for the launch pad.
