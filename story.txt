It is well known that werewolves transform according to the phases of the moon, but what would happen in a location where there were no phases? The moon itself, for example? 
 
That is exactly what Alfie Wolford - notorious lycanthrope, flight school flunk-out, and would-be hijacker aimed to find out.

If he could just find a way to sneak in on a flight undiscovered before NASA could kick him off. 

Now several weeks before, Alfie had gotten a job with NASA as the garbage collector. This had allowed him to bug all the important moon flight planning meetings. So he knew that the next launch was going to be this very evening. When he reported for work, he was ready to make a break for the launch pad.

Alfie managed to impersonate one of the astronauts that was scheduled for the next moon flight, by incapacitating him and taking his outfit and identification. He boarded the shuttle with the other 
astronauts and was successfully able to ride on the flight. He finally had his chance. The shuttle took off, and Alfie took some time to marvel at the glorious sights of outer space, but kept his eye 
on the prize as they slowly arrived at the moon. 

Being an emotionally-conscious werewolf with a stable mental health, Alfie 
took some time to process what he was feeling. Excitement, sure. But not 
in the sense that he was starting a new adventure to a far-off foreign 
place. More like he was returning from one. 

Huh. Strange. What was this familiarity? At first he thought it might be 
from the flight simulators he'd snuck onto while working as a janitor - he 
may have been breaking the law, but he'd be darned if he wasn't hijacking 
this flight prepared. 

But then, he caught a dark, prowling shape emerge from a lunar cave. Then 
two, then several. Surrounding the cave were discarded, stolen NASA badges 
and quite a bit of janitorial equipment.

That's what this was, he thought, smiling with fanged teeth. A homecoming.
